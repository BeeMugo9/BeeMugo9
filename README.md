👋 Hi, I’m @BeeMugo9

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am passionate about data science, public health, and policy analysis, with a rich background in statistics and research. 

👀 I’m interested in leveraging data to drive impactful policy decisions and improve public health outcomes. My work often intersects the realms of data analytics, health research, and policy development, focusing on creating data-driven solutions for complex health issues.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data science techniques and exploring innovative ways to apply them in the public health sector. I'm particularly interested in the application of machine learning and AI in healthcare data analysis and policy formulation.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to harness the power of data for public health improvements. I'm especially keen on initiatives that focus on mental health research, health policy analysis, and the development of data-driven healthcare solutions.

📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me here on GitHub or through [LinkedIn](Ywww.linkedin.com/in/bylhah-bylhah-m). 

As a statistics researcher, trainer, and policy analyst for the Government of Kenya, I bring a wealth of experience in handling large datasets, conducting in-depth statistical analysis, and translating findings into actionable policies. Feel free to explore my repositories, which include works related to my current focus on building a data science platform for mental health research in Africa.
